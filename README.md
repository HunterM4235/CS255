  The DriverPass Project is a system that will specialize in preparing student drivers for their real drivers tests. The system will be partnered with the DMV to keep information current and relevant. The goal of the system is to increase the percentage at which students pass their drivers tests. I beleive the system that I made is particularly well and covers all the requirments that DriverPass aspired to have. If I could pick one part of my documents to revise, I would revise the objective and goals portion of the Business Requirements Document. I beleive I could have gone more in depth for what the client DirverPass wants. 
  I interpreted the users needs as if I were the user. It is easier to have a feel for how the user would access the system that way and ensure that the system will meet the needs of the user as well. It is important to consider the user needs because that is who you are creating the system for, the system has a goal to help users and so it is important to consider their needs. However, there could be instances in which a system needs to consider user needs less. Such as a system that does not primarily affect users.
